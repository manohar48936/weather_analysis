# Weather Data Analysis

## Overview
Welcome to the Weather Data Analysis project! In this project, we dive into a weather dataset to uncover valuable insights through data analysis. Using Python and popular libraries, we tackle various questions and challenges related to weather conditions, wind speed, visibility, and more.

## Project Goals
The primary goal of this project is to analyze and visualize weather data effectively. We explore the dataset to answer key questions, identify trends, and gain insights into weather patterns. This project is a practical application of Big Data analysis techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains various attributes related to weather conditions, including:
- Wind Speed
- Weather Condition
- Visibility
- Pressure
- Relative Humidity

## Libraries Used
To facilitate our analysis, we utilize several Python libraries:
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis
- `numpy`: For numerical operations
- `matplotlib` or `seaborn`: For data visualization (if applicable)

## Analysis Questions
We addressed the following questions to analyze the dataset:

1. **Find all the unique 'Wind Speed' values in the data.**
2. **Count the instances when the 'Weather is exactly Clear'.**
3. **Count how many times the 'Wind Speed was exactly 4 km/h'.**
4. **Identify all Null Values in the data.**
5. **Rename the column 'Weather' to 'Weather Condition'.**
6. **Calculate the mean 'Visibility'.**
7. **Determine the Standard Deviation of 'Pressure' in this data.**
8. **Find the Variance of 'Relative Humidity' in this data.**
9. **Find all instances when 'Snow' was recorded.**
10. **Identify instances when 'Wind Speed is above 24' and 'Visibility is 25'.**
11. **Calculate the Mean value of each column against each 'Weather Condition'.**
12. **Find the Minimum & Maximum value of each column against each 'Weather Condition'.**
13. **Show all Records where Weather Condition is Fog.**
14. **Identify instances when 'Weather is Clear' or 'Visibility is above 40'.**
15. **Find instances where:**
    - **A. 'Weather is Clear' and 'Relative Humidity is greater than 50'**
    - **B. 'Visibility is above 40'**

## How to Run the Project
1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-data-analysis.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd weather-data-analysis
   ```
3. **Install the required libraries (if you haven't already):**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```
4. **Run the analysis script (replace ```your_script.py``` with the actual script name):**
   ```bash
   python your_script.py
   ```
## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of data analysis in understanding weather patterns. By answering various analytical questions, we gain insights that can inform decisions related to weather conditions. Feel free to explore the code and adapt it for your own analysis!
